      'Armstrong Build take pride in providing personal and dedicated customer service. A large percentage of our clientele comes from customer referrals and we aim to ensure that all customers receive a first class service that shows a dedication to building and sustaining long term working relationships based on trust. ``It has been a pleasure to have Phil do our building reconstruction 2 years ago. He has been honest and trustworthy which is important if you want to hand over your home to him. He has a good team of workers who respect him and work in harmony with him. He is transparent in his dealings and is a reliable person. He always picks his phone to answer your call, no matter how busy he is. He takes pride in the work he does and keeps in touch with us despite having completed his job. This goes to show the confidence he has in his own workmanship. We wish him well in his endeavours and hope to have him around for any building work we plan for the future.',

      "As the different tradesmen came to do their work we felt that they took a personal interest in the project and really cared about the end result, and had the skills to back this up. Our friends and neighbours are amazed at the transformation and the high quality of workmanship, and when they hear how enjoyable the process was they can't believe it, especially when they have either experienced or heard about renovation horror stories.",

      'All the tradesmen, from the first to the last to work on site, were courteous and personable. What impressed us the most, however, was their professionalism in delivering the highest quality work. The attention to detail they exhibited was quite extraordinary. The end result is a living space we are enjoying immensely!',
