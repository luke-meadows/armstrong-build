      'Armstrong Build take pride in providing personal and dedicated customer service. A large percentage of our clientele comes from customer referrals and we aim to ensure that all customers receive a first class service that shows a dedication to building and sustaining long term working relationships based on trust. ``It has been a pleasure to have Phil do our building reconstruction 2 years ago. He has been honest and trustworthy which is important if you want to hand over your home to him. He has a good team of workers who respect him and work in harmony with him. He is transparent in his dealings and is a reliable person. He always picks his phone to answer your call, no matter how busy he is. He takes pride in the work he does and keeps in touch with us despite having completed his job. This goes to show the confidence he has in his own workmanship. We wish him well in his endeavours and hope to have him around for any building work we plan for the future.',

      "As the different tradesmen came to do their work we felt that they took a personal interest in the project and really cared about the end result, and had the skills to back this up. Our friends and neighbours are amazed at the transformation and the high quality of workmanship, and when they hear how enjoyable the process was they can't believe it, especially when they have either experienced or heard about renovation horror stories.",

      'Throughout the rebuild of our kitchen, and re-roofing of our garage and utility room Armstrong build provided a high-quality service with no snags. With a building of this age and with its history we expected there to be hidden problems but can safely say that any problems that were found during the course of the work were dealt with in a way that was sympathetic to the building and in, line with the building regulations and the requirements of Bournville trust.  Work was completed on time and within expected budget and at all times we felt that Armstrong build contractors were always helpful and were keen to work with us to achieve the best for all concerned. I would certainly contact Armstrong build for any further work that we may need in the future.',
